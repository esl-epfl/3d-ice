     * sinkTemperatures are the temperatures in K of the layer of cells of the
     * heatsink that are in direct contact with those of the spreader.
     * You have to compute those. This is an inout parameter, as the previous
     * values are preserved across function calls.
     * 
     * thermalConductances are the thermal conductances in W/K between each
     * cell of the spreader and the one of the sink directly above. You have to
     * compute those at least once the first time this function is called.
     * The way to compute them is by paralleling the conductance passed to the
     * constructor (which is the conductance from the center of the spreader
     * cell to its top face) with a conductance that you have to compute, which
     * is the conductance from the bottom face of the sink to the center of the
     * sink cell. Although the spreader conductances coming from 3D-ICE are
     * uniform, the sink can have different conductances for each cell, that's
     * why it's a matrix. Also, you can update the conductances values during
     * the simulation to simulate e.g: two phase materials. Just remeber, every
     * time you update the conductances (including the first one!), you have
     * to return Conductances::CHANGED from this function! This is an inout
     * parameter, as the previous values are preserved across function calls.
     * 
     * Last, but not least, if you encounter an error, you can signal it by
     * throwing a C++ exception.
