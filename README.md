3D-ICE stands for 3D Interlayer Cooling Emulator. It is a Linux-based Thermal Emulator Library written in C, which can perform transient thermal analyses of vertically stacked 3D integrated circuits with inter-tier Microchannel Liquid Cooling. The latest version, namely 3D-ICE 3.1, supports fully customized non-uniform thermal modeling and different heat sink models.

To get more information about 3D-ICE, and how to use and install it, please refer to the [3D-ICE_User_Guide](doc/3D-ICE-User_Guide.pdf) in the doc folder. It helps you get started with 3D-ICE and serves as a quick reference later on. Click [here](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/esl/research/open-source-tools/3d-ice/3d-ice-documentation/) if you want to know more about the modeling theory aspects of 3D-ICE.

We are constantly looking for your feedback and comments in our strive to improve 3D-ICE. Please send your emails to 3d-ice@listes.epfl.ch. You must subscribe to this mailing list in order to be able to communicate with us and also receive notifications about new releases and updates on new patches, bugs, etc. Notifications will be kept as limited and as brief as possible and THERE WILL BE NO SPAMMING of your mailbox. In addition, this mailing list will serve as a forum where you can interact with other users of 3D-ICE.
